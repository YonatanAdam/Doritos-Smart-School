- **Teacher Dashboard**: Enables teachers to input, update, and manage grades for their respective classes.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes OleDb for seamless interaction with the backend database.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures secure access to the system with authentication mechanisms for students and teachers.

## Requirements
